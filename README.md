## Design Decisions
    - Sending messages can be from one user to multiple users
    - User can use only one custom folder to drag the needed files inside
    - In searching for messages by "to" attribute if you put multiple users, you will get messages to either of them (inclusively)

## User Guide
- Sign-Up & Sign-In
  Once you have opened the application, you will encounter the following page

  If you are already a user to our application, fill the required data correctly and click on Sign-In
  If you are a new user to our application, use the sign-up button and you will be redirected to the following page to register and get your account, but you will still need to sign-in

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
